# 27 — Authorization Model: Capability × Data Scope

## What this fixes

Today authorization is **one axis**: a role is a flat list of permission strings (`orders.read`,
`customers.create`), with a `:own` suffix bolted on for record ownership and `*` for "everything".
That conflates two questions a real access model must answer separately:

1. **Capability** — *what can you do, on which resource type?* ("full access to Orders, read-only on
   Customers, nothing on Billing")
2. **Data scope** — *which rows of that resource can you do it to?* ("all customers" vs "only my
   own" vs "only my region's subtree" vs "only records shared with me")

These are orthogonal. A dispatcher may **manage** Orders but only their **own**; a regional manager
may **view** Customers across a whole **subtree**. Collapsing them into one permission list can't
express that without a combinatorial explosion of strings, and it has no home for row rules beyond
`:own`. So Tam gets two independent grouping axes, layered.

## The layers

```
Tenant isolation   → which tenant's data exists for you at all      (global query filter, done)
Capability         → which actions on which resource types          (roles / permission sets)   AXIS 1
Data scope         → which ROWS of a resource each capability hits   (access policies)            AXIS 2
Field visibility   → which FIELDS of a row you may read/write        (capability field masks)     (opt-in)
```

A grant is only effective where **all** layers allow it: in-tenant AND capability-granted AND the
row in scope AND (if masked) the field visible.

## Axis 1 — Capability

### Resources declare actions; access levels bundle them

Each resource (Order, Customer, …) declares its **actions** — the atoms. CRUD-ish ones (`view`,
`create`, `edit`, `delete`) plus domain intents that aren't CRUD (`orders.complete`, `orders.assign`).
The permission strings we have today ARE these atoms; nothing is thrown away.

On top of the atoms sit **access levels** — ordered presets, so a role is authored ergonomically
instead of enumerating strings:

```
None  <  View  <  Edit  <  Manage
View   → view, list
Edit   → View + create, update
Manage → Edit + delete + the resource's admin/intent actions (complete, assign, configure fields…)
```

A **role** is then a map `resource → level` (with the escape hatch of naming individual actions when a
level is too coarse). "Full Orders, read Customers" is one role: `{ Order: Manage, Customer: View }`.
Levels expand to atoms at load time, so enforcement, the manifest, and the analyzer keep working on
the atom set exactly as today — levels are authoring sugar over a stable substrate.

### Field visibility (opt-in)

A resource may mark fields **sensitive** (e.g. `Customer.creditInfo`). A capability grant then carries
an optional field mask; a role can grant `Customer: View` while excluding sensitive fields. Read
masking drops the field from views/manifest; write masking rejects a `Change` to it. Off unless a
resource opts a field in — most resources never need it, and it's pure overhead until they do.

### Composition

Capability is the **union** across a membership's roles (more roles ⇒ more capability). No deny rules
(see Decisions) — deny is a footgun that turns "what can this user do" into a constraint-solve.

## Axis 2 — Data scope

A **scope** is a declarative row rule attached to a (resource, capability). Kinds, cheapest to richest:

- **all** — every row in the tenant. (Today's default.)
- **own** — rows the actor owns; the resource declares what "own" means (today's `:own`, unchanged).
- **subtree** — rows owned at or **below** the active node in the hierarchy — the *downward* roll-up
  (a region manager over all its companies). Path-prefix test: `row.TenantPath LIKE active.Path||'%'`.
- **inherited** — rows owned at or **above** the active node — the *upward* read of shared/reference
  data that is owned high and used by every leaf below it (a group-level price list or master catalog
  every company reads). The mirror prefix test: `active.Path LIKE row.TenantPath||'%'`. Only ever
  exposes the active node's *own* ancestors' rows, never a sibling subtree, so isolation holds.
- **where(attribute)** — an attribute predicate the resource defines and the policy parameterizes
  (e.g. `region == actor.region`, `team ∈ actor.teams`). Declarative, translated into the query.
- **shared** — explicit per-record grants (a share table: this record shared with this account/team).
  Distinct from `inherited`: `inherited` is structural (ancestor-owned), `shared` is an ACL per row.

Scope is **per (resource, capability)**, so "view all Orders but manage only your own" is two grants
with different scopes on the same resource. Scopes **union** (broadest wins) when several grants cover
the same capability — `all ⊇ subtree ⊇ own`, and `shared`/`where` add rows.

### Grouping: access policies (the separate axis)

Scopes group into named **access policies**, assigned per membership independently of roles:

- `own-only` = every resource scoped to `own`.
- `regional` = Customers/Orders scoped to `subtree` of the member's tenant.
- `full` = everything `all`.

So the two groupings are: **roles** (capability) and **access policies** (data scope). A membership
picks from each menu — the same role reused with different policies across memberships.

### Enforcement

- **Reads**: the view's declarative scope (generalizing today's `ScopedTo`) compiles the resolved
  scope into the query — `own` → owner predicate, `subtree` → path prefix, `where` → attribute
  predicate, `shared` → join the share table. One line per view, same as today.
- **Writes**: the operation re-checks the scope on the target row authoritatively (generalizing
  today's `CheckOwnership`) — a stale/forged id can't escape scope.
- Both ride the existing pipeline; the row rules live in one resolver, not per operation.

## The hierarchy write model (settled): grants fan out, writes fan in

This is the model chosen after a design review (prior-art + formal + implementation + UX). It is the
answer to "how do capability and create-target behave across the tenant tree."

**Reads and grants fan *out* over the tree; every write fans *in* to one node.** Formally: a read or
update targets an *existing* row, so its owning tenant is read off the row — always total and
unambiguous. A create targets a row that does not exist yet, so its tenant is a free variable that
must be *bound*; data-scope (a predicate over existing rows) cannot bind it. Therefore:

- **Create-target invariant.** Every create fans in to exactly **one explicit target node**, and the
  row is stamped with it; the target is **never inferred from a rolled-up read view**. The target is an
  explicit input that **defaults to the active node**:
  - Single-node actor (create scope = just the active node): the target *is* the active node, no
    prompt — a leaf worker never sees a chooser.
  - Subtree actor (an admin with a cascading `X.create` over a subtree): the create form surfaces a
    **target-node field** — a subtree-scoped lookup of the nodes they may create in — so they create an
    order **in a sub-company without switching active company** (the Azure "pick the resource group" /
    GitHub "pick the owner" pattern). The server validates the chosen target is within the actor's
    create data-scope (the `subtree` write re-check) and stamps it; a forged/out-of-scope target is
    rejected. The handler sets `TenantId` explicitly (like `DefineUser`), so the interceptor doesn't
    re-stamp.

  Capability stays **flat**: `X.create` is one bit in the manifest ("can create X"), gated once;
  *which* nodes is the data-scope axis, served by a lookup — not per-node capability. So this does NOT
  touch the `actorPermissions` → typed-client → UI-gating chain. What is rejected is per-node create
  *buttons* (one gated control per node), which would pluralize that flat set for no gain; the
  target-as-field keeps it singular. Switching the active node remains available but is never required
  to create in a node within your scope.

- **Capability across the tree** is the union up the active node's **cascading** ancestor memberships,
  collapsed to **one flat set** at the active node — so `Actor.Can`, the manifest, and the UI gating
  are unchanged (a bigger flat set, nothing more). Grants never flow up; downward flow is opt-in via a
  membership's cascade flag (the write-side mirror of `subtree`).

- **Ownership is at any level, domain-decided — there is no framework "leaf".** Transactional rows
  (orders) get `create` capability only at operating nodes; shared reference rows (catalogs) get it
  only at the group node. A row lives wherever it was created; descendants read shared rows via the
  `inherited` scope. "Leaf" (if a domain wants the concept) is *a node with no children* — computed,
  never a level number, and it changes as the tree grows.

- **Editing a shared (ancestor-owned) row** happens at its **owner node** — you switch up to manage
  the group catalog (same fan-in invariant, upward). A manager editing a rolled-up *descendant* row is
  the separate opt-in `subtree`-write case (the write-side scope re-check, net-new alongside `own`).

- **Dynamic, per-tenant depth** is native to the materialized `Path` (arbitrary N levels). The one
  operation with a cost is **re-parenting**: moving a subtree rewrites its `Path`, so the denormalized
  `TenantPath` on affected rows is rewritten in the same transaction (a bounded subtree update) — an
  explicit maintenance operation, not a pretense that paths are immutable.

## How it binds to identity (docs/26)

```
Account ──< TenantMembership(account, tenant) ──┬── roles          (capability)
                                                └── access policies (data scope)
```

A membership is the join of an account to a tenant, carrying **both** axes. Different tenants → different
roles and scopes for the same person. The hierarchy (docs/26): a membership attached at a parent node
plus `subtree` scope is exactly the roll-up a regional manager needs; a membership at a leaf with `own`
scope is a line worker. Seats (docs/24) count memberships per tenant.

## Backward compatibility

- Today's permission strings remain the atoms; existing roles (flat permission lists) are valid as
  "explicit action" grants with implicit `all` scope.
- `:own` becomes the `own` scope kind; `*` becomes `Manage` on every resource with `all` scope.
- The manifest keeps shipping the actor's effective capability (and now scope) so the UI and typed
  client keep hiding/showing on it. TAM004-style analyzer rules can later assert every resource
  declares its actions/levels.

## Decisions (settled)

- **D-A1 — access levels: YES.** `None/View/Edit/Manage` presets are the authoring model over the
  existing permission atoms (sugar; nothing downstream changes).
- **D-A2 — row-scope kinds: `all`, `own`, `subtree`, `where` now; DEFER `shared` (record ACLs).**
  Per-record sharing is a per-domain design later, not a framework primitive yet.
- **D-A3 — field-level: FULL now (read + write masking).** Resources opt a field in as sensitive; a
  grant can hide it from views/manifest (read) AND reject a `Change` to it (write).
- **D-A4 — deny rules: NO.** Union-grant only.
- **D-A5 — scope combination: UNION** (broadest wins) for the same capability.

## Sequencing note

This rides the identity work (D-H2 = platform-global accounts + memberships), since memberships carry
both axes. So the build order is: Account + TenantMembership + hierarchy path → this capability/scope
model on the membership → PKCE issuing account-subject tokens that name the active tenant + resolved
grants.
